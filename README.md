# Golden Horizon Yoga Management System

Welcome to the **Golden Horizon Yoga Management System**! This project is designed to manage a yoga center's operations, including user registration, class scheduling, instructor management, and contact communication.

- **Class Scheduling**: Users can view upcoming yoga sessions and enroll.
- **Instructor Management**: Admin can add and manage yoga instructors.
- **Contact Form**: Users can send queries or feedback through a contact form, with email notifications powered by **EmailJS**.
- **Toast Notifications**: Success and error messages are displayed using **react-toastify**.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the web application.
- **EmailJS**: For sending emails via the contact form.
- **React Toastify**: For displaying success and error notifications.
- **React Spinners**: For showing loading indicators when submitting the contact form.
